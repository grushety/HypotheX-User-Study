Anchors for class: Bliptor

Anchor 1 for class Bliptor:
  Conditions: ['Box Collecting > 9.01', 'Tool Worship <= 4.99']
  Precision: 1.0
  Coverage: 0.1489

Anchor 2 for class Bliptor:
  Conditions: ['Box Collecting > 9.01', 'Tool Worship <= 4.99']
  Precision: 1.0
  Coverage: 0.1451

WARNING:alibi.explainers.anchors.anchor_base:Could not find an anchor satisfying the 0.95 precision constraint. Now returning the best non-eligible result. The desired precision threshold might not be achieved due to the quantile-based discretisation of the numerical features. The resolution of the bins may be too large to find an anchor of required precision. Consider increasing the number of bins in `disc_perc`, but note that for some numerical distribution (e.g. skewed distribution) it may not help.
